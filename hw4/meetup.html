        <p> I attended Silicon Valley Code Camp hosted by PayPal on Saturday, October 7th 2017 in San Jose, CA. The code camp is community event where developers learn from fellow developers. This event happens only once in a year. During the day between 9-5pm, there were many sessions and I attended four of them. They are Numbers, Getting Started as a Modern Windows Developer, Cracking the Coding Interview and Hiring Coders with Whiteboard Interviews. </p>

        <h2>Sessions I attended at Silicon Valley Code Camp</h2>

        <p> In Number session, presenter pointed about how numbers are important for developers and how to use them generally. He explained us the history of numbers with their symbols and the regions they are used around the world. </p>

        <p> The section of cracking the coding interview was one of the most crowded sessions in the event. The presenter was Gayle Laakmann McDowell who is the author of Cracking the Coding Interview book. She explained what recruiters from leader companies (like Google, Facebook etc.) ask to developers during an interview. She especially pointed out which questions recruiters ask on the white board and how we should approach to those questions. The questions were mostly based back-end, object-oriented algorithm questions. She told developers that algorithm is important and which topics we should prepare before the interview. </p>

        <p> The last section I attended was Gayle Laakmannâ€™s session again. In that section, she explained techniques to hiring managers and recruiters what they need to do during the interview like choosing right coding question, behavioral questions and more.</p>
